      "body": "Unfortunately, I punctured my achilles last week after I recklessly bumped into a ladder with drill bits (ouch!). I was scared that I may have torn it, so I went to see my doctor. I was so relieved when she told me that nothing was lodged in my foot, and that I only had achilles tendonitis. Hopefully, I can go back to running and parkour in a few months (fingers crossed!).",

      "author": "Cervi Itis",
      "body": "I always wondered why my tonsils (located towards the back of the throat) got swollen whenever I caught a cold. I recently discovered that tonsils are lymph nodes! Because pathogens often enter the lymphatic system, our bodies send cells (like white blood cells) to lymph nodes to essentially \"ambush\" the invading pathogens. Isn't that so cool?!?! Go my army of lymphocytes!",
