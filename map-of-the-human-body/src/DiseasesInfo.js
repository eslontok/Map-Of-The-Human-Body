    {title: "Heart Disease", image: HeartDisease, body: "The heart drives the Cardiovascular System, the system responsible for circulating blood throughout the body. Beating approximately 60-100 times a minute, the heart is highly susceptible to malfunction and disease, many of which can lead to pain, fatigue, and sometimes death.\n\nThe primary cause of many heart-related diseases begins with hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure. Hypertension is typically diagnosed when the blood pressure (BP) reading is approximately greater than 130/85 mmHg where 130 mmHg is the pressure in the arteries when the heart pumps blood (contracts) and 85 mmHg is the pressure in the arteries when the heart fills with blood (relaxes). This indicates that the heart is overworked, which could lead to pathological hypertrophy (increase in muscle size) of the heart. Hypertension is caused by stress, poor diet and exercise, and obesity. Treatments include better diet and exercise, diuretics (promotes urination, lowering blood volume and therefore lowering blood pressure), and beta blockers (relaxes heart muscles, decreasing contraction strength).\n\nThere are 2 types of heart muscle hypertrophy: physiological and pathological. Physiological hypertrophy is the outward growth of heart muscle (increases chamber volume) that results from endurance training. This healthy increase in chamber size enables the heart to fill, pump, and circulate blood in greater volumes, greatly improving cardiac function and lowering resting heart rate. On the contrary, pathological hypertrophy is the inward growth of heart muscle (decreases chamber volume) that results from hypertension. This decrease in chamber size often cascades to several other cardiac diseases.\n\nDiastolic (filling) dysfunction is when the ventricles do not fill with adequate amounts of blood, often due to pathological hypertrophy caused by hypertension. As a result, each pump of the heart circulates reduced amounts of blood, leading to fatigue. Treatment includes treating hypertension directly.\n\nSystolic (ejection) dysfunction is when the ventricles fill normally but are unable to eject adequate amounts of blood, often due to damaged myocardial cells that line the chambers of the heart. This damage is usually caused by a heart attack, lowering the heart's contractility. Treatment includes treating hypertension directly.\n\nMyocardial Infarction (heart attack) is when blood flow to the heart is blocked or insufficient. The heart supplies the rest of the body with blood, but it also supplies itself with blood via coronary arteries. If these arteries receive a lack of blood flow (ischemia), regions of the heart get damaged (results in systolic dysfunction). Heart attacks are typically caused by atherosclerosis (narrowing of arteries - results from plaque and fat buildup) and lack of blood circulation (due to diastolic or systolic dysfunction). The best form of treatment is prevention - it is important to maintain a healthy diet and to exercise often. If prevention fails, then blood thinners, diuretics, and beta blockers may provide some relief."},
    {title: "Respiratory Disease", image: RespiratoryDisease, body: "The lungs are a spongy pair of organs that facilitate breathing, a process that involves inhalation (oxygen intake) and exhalation (carbon dioxide release) - this is the primary function of the Respiratory System. Due to constant gaseous exchange between the body and the environment, the lungs are known to contract several diseases.\n\nWithin the lungs is a complex network of tubes called bronchioles. Located at the ends of bronchioles are alveoli, tiny air sacs where gas exchange between the lungs and the capillaries takes place.\n\nAlveoli are composed of 2 types of cells: type I and type II. Type I cells comprise the majority of an alveolus and are responsible for gas exchange, while type II cells produce surfactant, a protein substance that acts as a lubricant. Surfactant lowers alveolar surface tension, making the alveolus less likely to burst and more compliant (easy to expand). Altogether, surfactant makes breathing easier.\n\nRespiratory Distress Syndrome is a disorder that affects premature babies. While in the womb, the fetus does not breathe - oxygen diffuses into the fetus via the placenta. Approximately 26 weeks into gestation, the fetus begins to produce its own surfactant so that it can breathe on its own when born. Premature babies are born too early and may not have produced enough surfactant, making breathing difficult. They are therefore placed in a ventilator to facilitate breathing while they finish producing surfactant.\n\nCompliance is a property of lungs that indicates their expandability. Having too much compliance leads to easy inflation but slow deflation (\"floppy lung\"), making breathing difficult. This is often associated with emphysema, the destruction of alveolar walls (decreases surface area for gas exchange) that is typically caused by smoking and exposure to polluted air. Treatments include bronchodilators (widens bronchioles) and supplemental oxygen (in extreme cases). Having too little compliance leads to lung stiffness, resulting in shortness of breath. This is often associated with fibrosis, the damage and scarring of alveolar tissue that is typically caused by long-term exposure to toxins and polluted air. Treatments include pulmonary rehab and drugs that slow fibrosis progression.\n\nBronchitis is the inflammation of bronchioles, constricting air passageways. Usually caused by viral infections and a polluted environment, bronchitis makes breathing difficult but can be treated with rest and bronchodilators.\n\nChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a condition caused by damage to lung airways and alveolar walls, making breathing difficult - bronchitis and emphysema are characteristic of COPD. Treatments include bronchodilators and supplemental oxygen.\n\nAsthma (usually genetically acquired) is a chronic inflammatory disease that targets the airways (bronchioles), causing inflammation and constricting air flow. Decreased compliance in the airways is characteristic of asthma. Treatments include bronchodilators and inhalers. Inhalers are beta-receptor agonists, which relax the smooth muscle cells of the airways, dilating them and improving air flow."},
    {title: "Kidney Disease", image: KidneyDisease, body: "The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs that specialize in filtering the blood, the main purpose of the Renal (or Urinary) System. Filtering approximately 180 liters of blood and producing about 1-2 liters of urine per day, the kidneys are prone to diseases and blockages that could lead to high blood pressure (can result in a heart attack), fatigue, and nausea.\n\nKidney stones are large, solid objects composed of mineral deposits that were filtered from the glomerular capillaries and into the Bowman's space (takes place inside nephrons, the functional units of the kidney). Kidney stones are formed when these deposits stick together in highly concentrated urine. Most kidney stones are composed of calcium oxalate (found in fruits and chocolate), but uric acid from meat can also crystallize into kidney stones. Under normal conditions, filtered contents from the kidneys enter the bladder via the ureters where they are stored as urine and eventually excreted through the urethra. Depending on its size, a kidney stone may get stuck inside the ureter, preventing urine from reaching the bladder. If left untreated, urine will build up inside the kidneys and lead to kidney failure, sepsis (severe inflammation), and in rare cases, death. This can easily be prevented by drinking more water - because kidney stones arise in highly concentrated urine, excess water will decrease the urine's ion concentration, effectively decreasing the likelihood of kidney stone formation. If prevention fails, taking alpha-blockers will relax the smooth muscles of the ureter, dilating it and allowing the kidney stones to pass through.\n\nNephritis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the kidneys, preventing the kidneys from properly filtering blood. This can lead to excess bodily fluids, highly concentrated blood, and unregulated acid-base balance. Symptoms include high blood pressure, fatigue, and bloody urine. Nephritis is caused by autoimmune disorders (ex: lupus), bacterial or virulent infections, high calcium and uric acid levels in the blood, and kidney stones. If left untreated, waste and toxins will accumulate in the bloodstream and lead to kidney failure and eventually, death. Treatments include dietary changes (decreasing consumption of foods high in salts and protein), antibiotics, and anti-inflammatory medications. If nephritis becomes too severe and inhibits kidney function, dialysis is implemented while the kidneys recover.\n\nDialysis is a medical procedure that filters the blood in place of the kidneys. Hemodialysis utilizes an external machine called a dialyzer (an artificial kidney) - blood is pumped from the body, filtered through the dialyzer, and returned to the body. Peritoneal dialysis involves the use of a dialysis solution (dialysate) and the peritoneum, the lining of the abdominal cavity. The dialysate is placed into the abdominal cavity via a catheter after which the peritoneum acts as a natural filter, allowing waste and excess fluids to move from the blood and into the dialysate. Afterwards, the dialysate is drained from the body, taking the waste with it."},
    {title: "Influenza (Flu)", image: Influenza, body: "Influenza (Flu) is a contagious respiratory disease caused by the influenza virus. This airborne virus originates from wild birds where the primary reservoirs for the virus are aquatic birds like waterfowl (ducks, geese, swans, etc.). Transmission to humans occurs via direct contact with an infected animal or exposure to an infected animal's environment (inhalation of airborne droplets that contain the virus). Transmission between humans easily takes place via a sneeze, cough, and poor hygiene.\n\nViruses replicate by invading an organism and hijacking host cells - the virus utilizes the cell's resources to replicate the viral genome. Afterwards, the newly assembled viruses lyse (break open) or bud from the host cell and spread to other cells. Viruses in general are volatile - they replicate at an alarming rate and are therefore susceptible to mutations, resulting in new strains or variants. The flu is no exception. This is the reason why new vaccines for the flu are developed each year.\n\nThe flu virus typically targets the upper respiratory tract (nose and throat), but it occasionally targets the lungs. It infects the epithelial cells that line these regions, triggering the body's immune system - immune responses include fever, cough, and a runny nose. Infected individuals experience fatigue and sometimes nausea.\n\nThe flu is typically short-lived, as the body (under normal conditions) is capable of combating the virus within 2 weeks. Treatments include rest, hydration, over-the-counter pain relief medications like Tylenol and Advil, and antiviral medications like Tamiflu."},
    {title: "Diabetes", image: Diabetes, body: "Diabetes Mellitus, commonly known as Diabetes, is a disease characterized by high blood sugar. When food is consumed, the food is broken down and absorbed by the digestive system, increasing blood glucose levels. Under normal conditions, beta cells in the pancreas release insulin (a hormone that facilitates glucose uptake into cells) to decrease blood glucose levels. With Diabetes, blood glucose levels remain high, which could lead to nerve and blood vessel damage, organ failure, and death.\n\nThere are 2 types of Diabetes Mellitus: Type I and Type II. Type I Diabetes (5% of Diabetes cases) is an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system mistakenly destroys beta cells in the pancreas, leading to insulin deficiency. This lack of insulin prevents cells from absorbing glucose in the bloodstream, keeping blood glucose levels high. Treatments include taking insulin shots. Type II Diabetes (95% of Diabetes cases) is a disease characterized by decreased responsiveness to insulin. This is caused by poor diet, lack of physical activity, and obesity (note that genetic factors increase the likelihood of developing the disease). If blood glucose levels remain chronically high, the pancreas will consistently secrete large amounts of insulin - over time, the cells develop insulin resistance (similar to how bacteria develop antibiotic resistance). As a result, the pancreas works \"overtime\", as the cells now require more insulin to facilitate glucose uptake - the cells are less inclined to absorb glucose, keeping blood glucose levels high. Treatments include maintaining a healthy diet and consistent exercise (keeps blood glucose levels in check). If blood glucose levels never reach a critically high point, then it is possible for individuals with Type II Diabetes to live a normal life. Other treatments include medications that increase the body's sensitivity to insulin like Ozempic.\n\nSeveral complications arise if Diabetes is left untreated. When cells do not absorb glucose, they become starved (they think blood glucose levels are low) and signal the body to break down glycogen (stored glucose), releasing additional glucose into the bloodstream. The kidneys are forced to filter out the excess glucose, pulling water and sodium ions with it. This results in decreased blood volume and decreased Na+ levels, which could lead to organ failure, impaired brain function, and death. Diabetic ketoacidosis is another complication where the body is signaled to break down fats for energy, resulting in ketones, an acidic molecule that serves as an alternative fuel source. This greatly increases the acidity of the blood, which could lead to organ failure, impaired brain function, and death."},
    {title: "Cancer", image: Cancer, body: "Cancer encompasses a broad range of diseases that are all characterized by the uncontrollable growth and division of cells. Cancer (can be inherited or acquired) is a genetic disease, meaning it arises from genetic mutations that alter the cell's ability to properly grow and divide. These changes are caused by natural mutations during cell division, but lifestyle and environmental factors like smoking, poor air quality, and exposure to radiation can cause DNA damage, increasing the risk of developing mutations.\n\nThe human body is composed of trillions of cells, which grow old and get damaged. Under normal conditions, cells grow and divide, forming new cells accordingly. However, any cell can suddenly become cancerous, which results in uncontrollable cell division that may spread to other parts of the body and form abnormal cell masses called tumors. Benign tumors are noncancerous and do not spread. On the contrary, cancerous (or malignant) tumors can invade surrounding tissues or undergo metastasis, a process where the cancer cells travel through the bloodstream or lymphatic system to form new tumors at a distant part of the body. Benign tumors usually do not grow back once removed whereas cancerous tumors may suddenly reappear. Many cancers are known to cause tumor formation, but blood cancers like leukemia generally do not.\n\nThere are over 200 types of cancers - the most common cancers include breast, prostate, lung, colon, and skin cancer. Cancer symptoms vary widely depending on the type of cancer, but they all typically include fatigue, fever, lumps, and unintended weight loss. If left untreated, many cancers can lead to significant pain, organ and system failure, and death.\n\nCancer treatment includes surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Surgery involves the removal of tumors (benign or cancerous) and any infected tissues. Chemotherapy is the use of medicinal drugs (taken intravenously or orally) that target cancerous cells - these drugs aim to kill cancerous cells and slow or stop abnormal cell growth and division. Radiation therapy involves the use of high-energy beams like X-rays to target and destroy cancer cells. While there is no guaranteed method to prevent cancer, maintaining a healthy lifestyle by eating a balanced diet, engaging in physical activity, and avoiding smoking and polluted air significantly reduce the risk of developing cancer-inducing mutations."}
