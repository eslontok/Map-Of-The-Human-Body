    {title: "Nervous", image: Nervous, body: "The Nervous System is the body's command center. Composed of the brain, spinal cord, and trillions of nerves, the nervous system is responsible for conscious thought, memory, and both voluntary and involuntary bodily functions.\n\nThe nervous system consists of the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS includes the brain and spinal cord and are responsible for processing information and coordinating responses. The PNS includes 7 trillion nerves that transmit signals between the CNS and the rest of the body. The PNS is divided into the somatic nervous system (enables voluntary movement) and the autonomic nervous system (regulates involuntary movement). The autonomic nervous system is further divided into 3 components: sympathetic (\"fight or flight\"), parasympathetic (\"rest and digest\"), and enteric (regulates digestion).\n\nNeurons (nerve cells) are the fundamental units of the brain and the nervous system as a whole. Composed of a cell body, an axon, and dendrites, these specialized cells are responsible for sending and receiving signals. These signals are generated via action potentials.\n\nThe action potential (an electrical signal) propagates down the axon via waves of depolarization, opening Ca2+ channels. The influx of Ca2+ ions causes vesicles (contains neurotransmitters, a chemical signal) to fuse with the membrane, releasing the neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft (the space between a presynaptic and postsynaptic cell). The binding of neurotransmitters to receptors embedded in the postsynaptic cell's membrane is what elicits a response."},
    {title: "Endocrine", image: Endocrine, body: "The Endocrine System is a network of ductless glands and organs that regulate various bodily functions via the release of hormones and hormone-secreting cells.\n\nHormones are chemical messengers that enter the bloodstream from the site of secretion (i.e., from a gland or organ) and travel to target cells. There are 3 types of hormones: amines (hydrophilic and bind to receptors on plasma membrane), peptides (hydrophilic and bind to receptors on plasma membrane), and steroids (hydrophobic and pass through plasma membrane to bind to intracellular receptors).\n\nThe pituitary gland is located at the base of the brain and is composed of an anterior and posterior component. Hormones of the anterior pituitary include FSH (promotes sperm and egg development), LH (signals estrogen and testosterone release), growth hormone (promotes growth), TSH (signals thyroids to release hormones), prolactin (promotes milk production), and ACTH (signals adrenal glands to release hormones). Hormones of the posterior pituitary include oxytocin (promotes milk ejection and love) and vasopressin (promotes water retention).\n\nThe thyroid glands are located in the neck and release thyroid hormones, which increases metabolism by regulating the transcription and translation of pumps and receptors for other hormones.\n\nThe adrenal glands are located just above the kidneys and release cortisol, the \"stress hormone\". Cortisol is released in response to stress, increasing blood glucose levels and temporarily \"turning off\" the immune system to suppress inflammation.\n\nThe pancreas is an organ located in the abdominal cavity and releases insulin (decreases blood glucose levels) and glucagon (increases blood glucose levels). Insulin promotes glucose uptake into cells where excess glucose is stored as glycogen in the liver, muscles, and fats, effectively decreasing blood glucose levels. Glucagon signals the breakdown of glycogen (becomes glucose) and releases the glucose back into the blood, effectively increasing blood glucose levels.\n\nTesticles (in males) produce testosterone, which regulates sperm production and development of male secondary sex characteristics. Ovaries (in females) produce estrogen, which regulates egg production and development of female secondary sex characteristics."},
    {title: "Musculoskeletal", image: Musculoskeletal, body: "The Musculoskeletal System is the body's framework. Composed of the skeleton and muscles, the Musculoskeletal System provides structure, movement, and protection.\n\nThe skeleton is composed of bones, rigid tissues that serve as anchors for muscles. Cartilage is present at joints to prevent friction and minimize wear and tear. Muscles are specialized tissues that enable movement via muscle contractions and relaxations. Ligaments connect bones to bones, while tendons connect muscles to bones.\n\nA sarcomere is a functional unit of skeletal muscle. It is composed of contractile proteins (actin (thin filament) and myosin (thick filament)), regulatory proteins (troponin and tropomyosin), ions, and ATP. At rest, actin and myosin are dissociated, as tropomyosin covers the myosin binding sites on the actin filaments. During a contraction, Ca2+ binds to troponin (bound to tropomyosin) and pulls the tropomyosin away, exposing the myosin binding sites on the actin filaments. Myosin then binds to actin after which a \"flicking\" motion takes place, generating a muscle contraction."},
    {title: "Cardiovascular", image: Cardiovascular, body: "The Cardiovascular System is a network of organs (heart) and blood vessels (arteries, capillaries, and veins) that are responsible for circulating blood throughout the body to transport oxygen and nutrients to cells and remove carbon dioxide and metabolic waste from the body.\n\nBlood is a specialized body fluid consisting of plasma, erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets. Plasma is composed of water, proteins, hormones, ions, and metabolic waste. Erythrocytes are red blood cells (RBCs) - these cells are the primary transporters of oxygen. Leukocytes are white blood cells (WBCs) - these cells protect the body against infection. Platelets are cells that specialize in blood clot formation.\n\nComposed of 4 chambers (left atrium and ventricle and right atrium and ventricle), the heart is the organ that drives the Cardiovascular System. Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart, while veins are blood vessels that carry blood toward the heart. Capillaries are thin blood vessels typically found in tissues and organs - their thin walls enable the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products between the blood and cells.\n\nSystemic Circuit: Freshly oxygenated blood from the lungs enters the left atrium via pulmonary veins. The blood then enters the left ventricle after which it gets pumped out to the rest of the body via the aorta. Exchange takes place at the capillaries between the blood and cells (oxygen is consumed). Pulmonary Circuit: The deoxygenated blood travels back to the heart and enters the right atrium via the vena cava. The blood then enters the right ventricle after which it gets pumped toward the lungs via pulmonary arteries where the blood is oxygenated."},
    {title: "Respiratory", image: Respiratory, body: "The Respiratory System serves 2 main functions: facilitate oxygen (O2) intake and carbon dioxide (CO2) release.\n\nA respiratory cycle refers to a breath (i.e., one cycle of inhalation and exhalation), a process that takes place in the lungs, a spongy pair of organs located in the chest. Within the lungs is a network of tubes called bronchioles. Located at the ends of bronchioles are alveoli (tiny air sacs), the functional units of the Respiratory System. The high surface area between the alveoli and the capillaries that wrap around them enable the effective exchange of gas.\n\nDuring inhalation, the diaphragm (a dome-shaped muscle located below the lungs) contracts and pushes down, expanding the lungs and facilitating air intake. At this time, oxygen levels are high in the alveoli and low in the deoxygenated blood in the capillaries. This concentration gradient allows oxygen to passively diffuse from the alveoli and into the capillaries. On the contrary, carbon dioxide (a metabolic waste product of cells) levels are high in the capillaries and low in the alveoli, resulting in the passive diffusion of carbon dioxide from the capillaries and into the alveoli. During exhalation, the diaphragm relaxes, causing the lungs to shrink and release the carbon dioxide into the environment."},
    {title: "Renal", image: Renal, body: "The Renal System (or Urinary System) is an organ system whose primary goal is to filter the blood. Consisting of the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra, the Renal System is responsible for regulating water, ion, and acid-base balance in the blood and excreting metabolic waste and other foreign chemicals. This system follows 4 main processes: filtration, reabsorption, secretion, and excretion.\n\nThe kidney is a specialized organ where the filtering of blood takes place where each kidney contains approximately 1 million nephrons, the functional unit of the kidney. Each nephron is composed of 2 components: the renal corpuscle and the renal tubule.\n\nThe renal corpuscle is where filtration takes place, specifically in the Bowman's capsule. The pressure in the glomerular capillaries filters the contents of the blood into the Bowman's space by size (this movement is called bulk flow). If the contents are small enough, they get filtered, regardless of type (ex: water, electrolytes, glucose, vitamins, urea, etc.).\n\nThe renal tubule is a series of tubules and ducts (surrounded by peritubular capillaries, arteries, and veins) where reabsorption and secretion take place. Due to filtration's nonspecificity, some of the contents that are essential to the body have been filtered from the blood. These essential contents are forcibly reabsorbed by type from the tubule and into the peritubular capillaries. Metabolic waste and excess ions that were not initially filtered (due to its large size or quantity) are forcibly secreted by type from the peritubular capillaries and into the tubule. All contents that remain in the tubule make their way to the bladder via the ureter where they are stored as urine.\n\nWhen ready, the body excretes the urine via the urethra where amount excreted = amount filtered - amount reabsorbed + amount secreted."},
    {title: "Digestive", image: Digestive, body: "The Digestive System consists of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and accessory organs that aid in digestion and is responsible for breaking down food and absorbing the resulting nutrients. This system follows 4 main processes: ingestion, digestion, absorption, and elimination.\n\nThe GI tract (or alimentary canal) refers to the entire passageway that spans from the mouth to the anus. Accessory organs include teeth, glands, and any organs involved in digestion.\n\nIngestion is the act of placing food and liquid in the mouth. Digestion is the physical and chemical breakdown of food and liquids. Absorption is the process of bringing nutrients into the blood. Elimination refers to the excretion of waste products.\n\nDigestion always begins in the mouth - the act of chewing mechanically breaks down food, while glands secrete saliva. Saliva lubricates the food (for easier swallowing) and contains amylase (chemically breaks down carbs) and lipase (chemically breaks down fats). The food then makes its way through the esophagus via peristalsis and enters the stomach. The stomach stores food and digests it by secreting hydrochloric acid (HCl), a highly corrosive substance that further breaks down food into a slimy substance called chyme. The acidic environment created by the presence of HCl converts pepsinogen into pepsin, a digestive enzyme that chemically breaks down proteins. Afterwards, the chyme enters the small intestine, a long tube that consists of the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The duodenum and jejunum facilitate digestion and absorption, while the ileum transports food to the large intestine. Bile (a substance produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder) and pancreatic juices (contains amylase, proteolytic enzymes, and lipase) from the pancreas are secreted into the small intestine. Bile contains bile salts, which mechanically solubilize fats and break them into smaller globules. The small intestine's inner lining (known as the brush border) is highly convoluted to increase surface area, ultimately maximizing the digestion of food and the absorption of nutrients.\n\nInside the large intestine, water absorption primarily takes place - this dehydrates the remaining contents, solidifying the waste into stool. This waste is ultimately excreted as feces via defecation.\n\nIt is important to maintain a balanced and diverse gut microbiome - the microbiome bacteria produce vitamin K (vital for blood clotting), aids in metabolism, and educates the body's immune system. Failure to do so (via poor diet or overuse of antibiotics) may result in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other autoimmune disorders."},
    {title: "Reproductive (Male)", image: ReproductiveMale, body: "The Male Reproductive System includes the testicles, epididymis, vas deferens, ejaculatory duct, and several glands. Together, they are responsible for the production and delivery of sperm and producing testosterone, the male sex hormone.\n\nThe testicles (or testes) are the male gonads - this is where sperm is synthesized via a process called spermatogenesis (a meiotic process).\n\nPrimary spermatocytes (diploid) synthesized by Sertoli cells undergo their first meiotic division to become secondary spermatocytes (haploid). Afterwards, a second meiotic division takes place, resulting in spermatids (haploid). This entire process takes place in the seminiferous tubules (highly convoluted) inside the testicles. These tubules eventually lead to the epididymis, another set of tubules where the spermatids mature into sperm cells. Upon maturation, the sperm is stored in a thicker tubule called the vas deferens.\n\nDuring a male orgasm (ejaculation), the sperm travels through a series of ducts (ejaculatory duct and urethra) and encounters several glands along the way. The seminal vesicles secrete chemicals that promote sperm motility and fructose (food for the sperm) into the ejaculatory ducts - substances secreted by the seminal vesicles comprise 60% of semen. The ejaculatory duct leads to the urethra where the prostate gland secretes bicarbonate (HCO3-) to buffer the acidity of the vagina (comprises 30% of semen). Bulbourethral glands also secrete lubricating fluids and fluids that buffer residual urine into the urethra (comprises < 1% of semen). The remaining 10% is the sperm. Semen is the resulting fluid that is ejaculated out of the penis.\n\nTestosterone (the male sex hormone) is produced by Leydig cells in the testicles. During development, the fetal testes secrete testosterone, which promotes the development of the male reproductive system (duct and penis formation). Testosterone also plays a role in the initiation and maintenance of spermatogenesis and the development of male secondary sex characteristics (body hair, muscles, etc.)."},
    {title: "Reproductive (Female)", image: ReproductiveFemale, body: "The Female Reproductive System includes the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and the uterus. Together, they are responsible for producing eggs, nourishing a fertilized egg, giving birth, and producing estrogen, the female sex hormone.\n\nThe ovaries are the female gonads - this is where eggs (oocytes) are synthesized via a process called oogenesis (eggs are contained in fluid-filled sacs called follicles). A primary oocyte (diploid) undergoes its first meiotic division to become a large and small secondary oocyte (both haploid). The small one becomes the first polar body (discarded), while the large one is an egg that is capable of being fertilized by sperm. If fertilization takes place, the secondary oocyte undergoes its second meiotic division, resulting in a mature ovum (haploid) and the second polar body (discarded). The fertilized egg eventually becomes a zygote (diploid).\n\nUnder normal circumstances, the female body is always working to make a baby, constantly cycling between the ovarian and uterine cycle (a complete cycle takes approximately 28 days). The ovarian cycle involves changes in the ovary - this includes the development and release of an egg for potential fertilization. The uterine cycle involves changes in the uterus - this includes the preparation of the baby's \"living quarters\" in the event that fertilization takes place.\n\nDays 1-7: In the ovaries, a group of follicles enlarge where a single follicle eventually becomes dominant. In the uterus, the endometrium (the inner lining of the uterus) that was prepared from the previous cycle is broken down, resulting in menstruation.\n\nDays 8-14: In the ovaries, hormonal levels rapidly increase (estrogen, FSH, LH), resulting in an LH surge. This induces ovulation - the dominant follicle ruptures and releases the egg into the fallopian tubes where it waits for fertilization. In the uterus, high estrogen levels facilitate the thickening of the endometrium.\n\nDays 15-28: In the ovaries, the remaining non-dominant follicles comprise the corpus luteum, which secretes large amounts of estrogen and progesterone, exerting negative feedback to decrease FSH and LH levels (ensures that no new follicles develop). In the uterus, glycogen and glycoproteins are secreted into the endometrium, enriching it with nutrients.\n\nIf fertilization does not take place, the corpus luteum degenerates and estrogen and progesterone levels drop.\n\nIf fertilization does take place, the corpus luteum persists and maintains elevated levels of estrogen and progesterone. The fertilized egg becomes a zygote and makes its way to the uterus where it undergoes several mitotic divisions to become a blastocyst, which implants into the endometrial wall. The placenta is eventually formed and nourishes the developing embryo (approximately 40 weeks) until parturition (childbirth).\n\nEstrogen (the female sex hormone) is produced in the ovaries. It plays a major role in the ovarian and uterine cycles and the development of female secondary sex characteristics (breast development and widening of hips)."},
    {title: "Immune", image: Immune, body: "The Immune System is a complex network of cells, ducts, and organs that prevents pathogens and other foreign substances from entering the body and destroys any that manage to do so.\n\nThe Immune System consists of an innate and adaptive component. The innate immune system is non-specific and typically serves as the body's first line of defense. This includes physical barriers like the skin and mucus that line the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract. Phagocytes (cell eaters) like macrophages and neutrophils (the most common type of leukocyte) engulf and destroy pathogens. Despite its quick response, the innate immune system lacks memory - it generally tackles each infection in the same manner and fails to recognize specific pathogens that have been previously encountered. The adaptive immune system has a slower response to unknown (new) infections, but it trains the body to recognize specific pathogens. This enables the body to effectively neutralize subsequent infections caused by previously-encountered pathogens in a much more efficient manner.\n\nAdaptive immunity is the principle that vaccines are based on. Vaccines contain a weaker or inactive variant of a pathogen. Injecting the body with this substance educates the immune system, allowing the body to recognize pathogens involved in a real infection like the influenza virus (the flu). Note that viruses are volatile, often mutating and resulting in new strains - this is why there are multiple vaccines for the \"same virus\".\n\nThe adaptive immune system includes specialized leukocytes called T cells and B cells. T cells are produced in the bone marrow and mature in the thymus (hence, T). The most important T cells are helper T cells (activates other cells involved in an immune response) and cytotoxic T cells (detects and destroys infected cells). Some helper T cells become memory T cells after combating an infection, allowing the body to identify repeat pathogens. B cells (activated by helper T cells) are produced and mature in the bone marrow (hence, B). B cells express unique antigen-specific receptors (membrane-bound antibodies) - when an antigen (something that triggers an immune response) is detected, B cells attempt to bind to it. When a match is found, B cells differentiate into memory B cells and plasma B cells. Memory B cells are essentially copies of the parent B cell and carry the same membrane-bound antibodies - this acts as a form of memory, as antibodies are unique to a particular antigen. Instead of being membrane-bound, the same antibodies are secreted by plasma B cells. These antibodies circulate and bind to matching, free-roaming antigens, suppressing the antigen and making it easier for phagocytes to consume.\n\nB cells and T cells are commonly found in the blood and in the lymphatic system, a network of vessels (contains a fluid called lymph) and lymph nodes. The lymphatic system collects fluid that leaks out during capillary exchange and returns it back to the bloodstream. This system's accessibility to the bloodstream allows it to quickly circulate leukocytes. Leukocytes typically congregate at lymph nodes, as these nodes filter lymph fluid and trap pathogens (this is why lymph nodes like the tonsils enlarge when fighting an infection)."}
